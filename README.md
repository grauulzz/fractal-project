# fractal-project

This program writes a fractal image to a bitmap file in c++ using the Mandlebrot set to plot it's cooridinates (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) 

After Mandelbrot's alg is applied to the cooridinates system of the fractal image, 
points of a given pixel's stability/instability are added to a histogram 
We create a database of the histogram's values to use them for coloring and zooming in on the fractal image

I am no expert in the mandlebrot set, and there is still much I'd like to do / learn in regards to this project!
I'd like to give credit to caveofprogramming's advanced c++ course. Helped me out a lot along the way!


TODO: 

  add a ring buffer to pre render / show the images as they are being generated by the program
  
  add a GUI which allows for easy input of zoom coordinates / coloring of fractal
