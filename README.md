# fractal-project

This program writes a fractal image to a bitmap file in c++ using the Mandlebrot set to plot it's cooridinates (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) 

(extremely brief description)

Points of a given pixel's stability/instability are added to a histogram of cooridinate values (database)
We use these database to color and zoom in on the fractal image based of which pixel's total amount of iterations are stable or unstable as the mandelbrot set is appiled to each cooridinate value (complex numbers are used to represent coordinate values of histogram)



I am no expert in the mandlebrot set, and there is still much I'd like to do / learn in regards to this project!
I'd like to give credit to caveofprogramming's advanced c++ course. Helped me out a lot along the way!


TODO: 

  add a ring buffer to pre render / show the images as they are being generated by the program
  
  add a GUI which allows for easy input of zoom coordinates / coloring of fractal
